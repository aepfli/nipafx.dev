Over the last few weeks I had the opportunity to polish [my posts about Project Jigsaw](tag:project-jigsaw) for InfoQ.
The result was published today:

**[Project Jigsaw is Really Coming in Java 9](http://www.infoq.com/articles/Project-Jigsaw-Coming-in-Java-9)**

Besides refining what I wrote about [motivation, goals](motivation-goals-project-jigsaw), [the core concept, features](features-project-jigsaw) and [risks](how-java-9-and-project-jigsaw-may-break-your-code) it casts light on the history and current structure, and presents the strawman syntax from [JEP 200](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/200).
If you haven't read much about Jigsaw, this is your chance to get a comprehensive view of it.

And thanks to [Victor Grazi](http://www.infoq.com/author/Victor-Grazi) for his excellent editing and perseverance.
It improved and tightened the text noticeably.

## Next Steps

Working on the article took a lot of time.
(Which is why I count this lousy announcement here as one of the three posts I want to publish each month.) But now that I am done with that the road is clear to experimenting with the module system itself!

This be possible as soon as the current work on [JSR 376](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=376) is merged into the OpenJDK repositories, which can happen [any day now](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/jigsaw-dev/2015-July/004393.html).

Stay tuned.
