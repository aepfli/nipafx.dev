Every [turn of the year](tag:turn-of-the-year), I write a pair of posts: One looks back on my professional achievements and failures of the passing year, the other one defines goals for the next one.
I used to publish these posts here on CodeFX:

-   [Goodbye 2014](goodbye-2014) and [Hello 2015](hello-2015)
-   [Goodbye 2015](goodbye-2015) and [Hello 2016](hello-2016)
-   [Goodbye 2016](goodbye-2016) and [Hello 2017](hello-2017)

That was never a good fit, though, because this blog is supposed to contain only technical content.
But this year, I have [an active newsletter](news) where such content fits in perfectly, so I use it for these two posts.
If you don't feel like [subscribing](news), head over to Medium, [where I publish them a few days after](http://medium.com/codefx-weekly) (including [full RSS](https://medium.com/feed/codefx-weekly)).

In fact, [Goodbye 2017 is already online](https://medium.com/codefx-weekly/goodbye-2017-14ecd2481cba), Hello 2018 will show up next week ([here you go](https://medium.com/codefx-weekly/hello-2018-f7a284abc1f1)).

**I wish you a happy new yearâ€™s eve!
I hope to see you again in 2018.**
