You can tell that Java 9 draws near because the number of posts and talks about it skyrocketed in the recent months.
I want to recommend existing talks and articles where you can learn about Java 9 but also further resources, where new, high-quality content will pop up.

## Talks

If you're the kind of person who likes to watch talks, there are quite a few I can recommend.
For a great high-level overview and conceptual intro to the module system, watch [*Java 9: Make Way for Modules!*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj_nUbIhJg8) (Mark Reinhold; 40 min).
Going deeper into the module system, the JDK team has an entire series of talks:

-   [*Introduction to Modular Development*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eALw4P_0O4k) (Alan Bateman; 55 min)
-   [*Advanced Modular Development*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJHjKMIrbD0) (Mark Reinhold, Alan Bateman; 60 min)
-   [*Project Jigsaw: Under The Hood*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxB9cVNcyZo) (Mark Reinhold; 60 min)

As a follow-up, there was an [*Ask the Architect* session at JFokus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO1fumd8e4o) where Mark Reinhold answers all kinds of questions, among them some about Java 9 (transitive dependencies, version conflicts, state of JavaFX, ahead-of-time compilation; 23 min).

With Java 9 coming closer, people started presenting on non-modularity features that Java 9 has to offer.
Simon Ritter races through [55 new features in JDK 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMMzG8I23lY) (50 min) and [this is me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOdFuvIyN0E) talking a little bit about the module system before going into the new language features, a few new APIs (collection factories, reactive streams aka Flow API, stack-walking, multi-release JARs) and performance (50 min).
If you want to dive deeper, there is a [talk by Aleksey ShipilÃ«v](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIyeOaitmWM) on compact strings and indified string concatenation, which I highly recommend (60 min).
[Monica Beckwith explains about G1](https://vimeo.com/181948157) but be warned, you better have your GC expertise down before giving this a try (55 min).

There are also a number of great talks that are much more practical.
To learn about how Maven deals with with Java 9, [watch Robert Scholte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wef9p4ykNMM) talk about Unicode encoding, version strings, cross compilation, multi-release JARS, and then of course Jigsaw with its impact on how Maven works but also what it has to offer (50 min).
Don't miss live-coding queen [Trisha Gee working on a Java 9 project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96vce1qd0QY) with IntelliJ, where she demonstrates various features of both the JVM and the IDE (30 min).
If you're interested to see what a migration to Java 9 modules might look like, [watch Rabea Gransberger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUZb4iOaizg) live-refactor a small demo project (15 min).
Of course there is no way to talk about live-coding without mentioning Venkat Subramaniam, who shows off modules and JShell [in a mammoth 150 minute live session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XmYT89fBKg).

For shorter bits there are a couple of interviews the Voxxed folks recorded:

-   [Mark Reinhold talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R83xS0bNHTM) about strong encapsulation, open modules, compatibility, and `sun.misc.Unsafe` (10 min).
-   [Venkat Subramaniam talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjJBau4ZNyA) about compatibility, the Flow API, and wishes for future Java versions (13 min).
-   [I talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZu6MGefHU0) about migration and command line escapes (not yet [the new `--permit-illegal-access`](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/jigsaw-dev/2017-March/011763.html), though) (7 min)

## Repositories

Of course people started writing code and there are a few interesting repositories that demonstrate Java 9 features:

-   [CodeFX/java-9](https://github.com/nipafx/demo-java-x): A repository demonstrating all kinds of Java 9 features
-   [AdoptOpenJDK/jdk9-jigsaw](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/jdk9-jigsaw): Examples of some of the module system features
-   [CodeFX/jigsaw-advent-calendar](https://github.com/nipafx/demo-jigsaw-advent-calendar): A simple demo application demonstrating JPMS features
-   [CodeFX/jpms-monitor](https://github.com/nipafx/demo-jpms-monitor): The JPMS demo application I use in my book

## Articles

There are countless articles about Java 9, so there is simply no way to do everyone justice.
Here's my try of listing the more important ones.

Overviews:

For a longer list of posts, check out [Baeldung's Java 9 site](http://www.baeldung.com/java-9).

I want to end whit list with a teaser: One particular interesting part about Java 9 modularity is whether build tools will generate module declarations.
Next Monday Robert Scholte, chairman of the Apache Maven project and principal developer of Maven's Java 9 compatibility and features, will tell us whether Maven can do that for you.
Spoiler: It doesn't look good.

## Blogs

There are a few blogs and sites that regularly publish about Java 9.
Most of them have the decency to tag those posts, so you don't have to go searching.

Company blogs/sites:

-   [Oracle](https://blogs.oracle.com/java/) (no Java 9 tag)
-   [SitePoint](http://sitepoint.com/tag/java-9/) (surprise!)
-   [Voxxed](https://www.voxxed.com/blog/tag/java-9/) (including a [nice series](https://www.voxxed.com/blog/tag/java-9-series/))

Personal blogs:

-   [Baeldung](http://www.baeldung.com/tag/java-9/) (Eugen Baeldung)
-   [Iteratr Learning](http://iteratrlearning.com/articles) (no Java 9 tag; Raoul-Gabriel Urma and Richard Warbuton)
-   [CodeFX](tag:java-9) (mine)
-   [Joda](http://blog.joda.org/search/label/java9) (Stephen Colebourne)

## Books and Courses

If you want to go really deep and prepare yourself for actually using the new stuff, you might want to go for a book or online course.
These are the ones I know of:

And because this is my blog I will take the freedom to make sure you don't overlook that the last book on that list is by me, which of course makes it the best one.
