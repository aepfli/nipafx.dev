I'm terribly sorry this happened and I really hope you can find what you're looking for - on this blog, but also in life.
It's not easy to achieve your goals and broken sites throwing a wrench into your daily business aren't exactly helping.

But look at the bright side: You're out and about learning about Java and that's pretty cool!
I'd love to help you with that as much as I can:
If you [reach out to me](contact) and let me know what you were looking for, I'll find it and get back to you ASAP.
