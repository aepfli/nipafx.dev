[JavaOne 2015](https://community.oracle.com/community/java/javaone) saw [a series of talks](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/j1/) by the Project Jigsaw team about modularity in Java 9.
They are all very interesting and full of valuable information and I urge every Java developer to watch them.

Beyond that I want to give the community a way to search and reference them, so I summarize them here:

* [Prepare For JDK 9](javaone-2015-prepare-for-jdk-9)
* [Introduction To Modular Development](javaone-2015-introduction-to-modular-development)
* [Advanced Modular Development](javaone-2015-advanced-modular-development)
* [Under the Hood Of Project Jigsaw](javaone-2015-under-the-hood-of-project-jigsaw)

I made an effort to link to as many external resources as possible to keep the individual posts short.
The play icons will take you straight to the corresponding point in the ten hour long video streams that Oracle put online for each room and day.
(Great format, folks!)
Not only did they (so far) fumble the cutting, they also seem to have resorted to low-volume mono sound so make sure to crank up the volume.
