By now Java 8's features are well understood, but some practical details are still unclear. Did you ever wonder...

* how to create a "lambda-enabled" API?
* whether your methods should return or even accept `Stream`s and how that might impact your design?
* how to write readable `Stream` pipelines, especially when exceptions are involved?
* about the details of and opinions on `Optional`?
* how to use default methods to evolve interfaces without breaking client code?

This talk discusses these and other advanced topics of Java 8, so you can get the most out of its awesome features.

## Pitch

Like the abstract says, best practices are still forming and many developers I talked to are curious to learn more about how to best use Java 8's features. This is in line with my observation that most technical conference talks stick to explaining a feature's basics but do not provide advanced insights on how to best utilize it. The proposed talk remedies this situation by providing exactly that insight.

I wrote a number of [articles about Java 8](http://blog.codefx.org/tag/java-8/), here are some of the more relevant ones:

* [Interface Evolution With Default Methods](http://blog.codefx.org/design/patterns/interface-evolution-with-default-methods-methods/)
* [Java 8 SE Optional, a strict approach](http://blog.codefx.org/java/stephen-colebourne-optional-a-strict-approach/)
* [Getting Rid Of Anonymous Classes](http://blog.codefx.org/techniques/getting-rid-of-anonymous-classes/)
* [Stream Performance](http://blog.codefx.org/java/stream-performance/)
* [Rebutting 5 Common Stream Tropes](http://blog.codefx.org/java/rebutting-5-common-stream-tropes/)

I also [held this talk before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3mDjgdZJSc) - you can see [the slides here](http://slides.codefx.org/expert-java-8/2017-02-07-jfokus/#/).
