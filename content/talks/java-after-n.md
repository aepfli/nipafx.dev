Many projects are still on Java 8 and yet, Java 14 is already out! The small releases after 9 created the illusion of nothing much happening, but nothing could be further from the truth - a lot changed since then that shapes the look of everyday Java code:

* new language features like records, switch expressions, `var`, and text blocks
* new APIs like stack walking and the reactive HTTP/2 client
* additions to existing APIs, like `Stream` and `Optional`

In this talk, we'll take a simple Java 8 code base, update it to 14, and refactor it to use the new language features and APIs. You'll be surprised how much the code changes!

<!--
Most projects that updated past Java 8 decided to stick to the LTS release 11.
The new cadence created the illusion of not much happening after that, but nothing could be further from the truth - with new language features like switch expressions, text blocks, records, and sealed classes, Java is moving faster than ever.

In this talk, we'll take a simple Java 11 code base, update it to 15, and refactor it to use the new language features and APIs.
You'll be surprised how much the code changes!
