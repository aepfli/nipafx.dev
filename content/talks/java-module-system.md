Java 9 shipped the Java Platform Module System, which brings language-level modularity to the Java ecosystem.
But you already know that and even spent some time to learn the basics?
That's great because this talk takes you beyond that and shows how to...

* model finer-grained dependencies and APIs
* decouple modules with services
* weigh encapsulation versus reflection
* analyze dependencies with `jdeps`
* safe the day with important command line flags
* create runtime images with `jlink`

With this under your belt, you're ready to become your team's module system expert.

## Pitch

Most conference presentations on JPMS / Project Jigsaw cover the basics. But with speakers talking about it throughout all of 2016 and 2017 (me among them) it is time to present attendees who already watched those talks with what they need to know to go to the next level _without_ repeating what they already know. Hence this talk assumes attendees know the basics and builds on them.

I migrated a ~1.5 million LOC application to Java 9. I have been [writing about Project Jigsaw][fx-jigsaw] and [the module system][fx-jpms] since early summer 2015 and am currently writing [a book about it with Manning][jms]. I also [blog about Java 9][fx-java-9] and wrote [the Ultimate Guide to Java 9][sp-java-9], an article read by thousands. I have been talking at [a number of conferences][fx-talks] about Java 8, Java 9, Project Jigsaw, and JUnit 5.

The talk will build [on this slide deck][fx-slides-jpms].
