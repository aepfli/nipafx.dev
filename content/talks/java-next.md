With Java's switch to a six-month release schedule, the community needs to step up its game to stay up to date.
Instead of having a year or more to prepare for a new release, it's a mere three months - we need to be better informed about what's going on to see changes coming before they're out.

This talk:

* explains the details behind the new schedule and how to stay up to date
* discusses license and support of JVM distributions
* showcases Java 9 to 15 language features like `var`, `switch` expressions, and records
* shows the future of Java, brought by projects like Valhalla, Amber, and others
* looks at features of upcoming releases like pattern matching, value types, and fibers

Afterwards, you will not only know about the immediate future but also how to stay up to date without much effort.
