This course teaches everything a Java developer needs to know when starting to work with 11:
It introduces new language features like private interface methods and `var`, explains new and updated APIs like the reactive HTTP/2 API, `Stream`, and `Optional`, and discusses JVM improvements like unified logging and multi-release JARs.
(The Java module system is not included - it comes as [a separate course](course-java-module-system).)
All of these topics are taught with theoretical introductions, practical exercises, and usage recommendations.

Beyond introducing everything new in Java 9 to 11 (except modules), this course also discusses technical migration challenges, the six-month release cadence, and licensing/support of JDK distributions.
