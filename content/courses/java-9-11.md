This course teaches everything a Java developer needs to know when starting to work with Java 11:
It introduces new language features, new and updated APIs, JVM improvements, and the essentials of the Java module system (for a deeper dive, there's [a separate course](course-java-module-system)).
All of these topics are taught with theoretical introductions, practical exercises, and usage recommendations.

Beyond introducing everything new in Java 9 to 11, this course also teaches how to overcome migration challenges and discusses the six-month release cadence as well as licensing/support of JVM distributions.

## Objectives

After completing this course, participants will be able to:

* assess and perform a project's migration from Java 8 to 11
* determine a Java update strategy and pick a JDK distribution that fits their project
* use new language features to write more readable and maintainable code
* use new and improved APIs to their full effect
* understand what the module system has to offer
* improve their projects with new JVM features

## Program

* migration from Java 8 to 11
* release cadence, distributions, and support
* new language features like `var` and private interface methods
* new APIs like collection factories, reactive streams, and the reactive HTTP/2 client
* updated APIs like `Stream`, `Optional` and OS processes
* Java module system basics
* new JVM-Features like scripting support, unified logging, and multi-release JARs
* performance improvements like application class-data sharing

<!--

## Details

### Java Today

* migration from Java 8 to 11
* release cycle and update strategies
* JVM vendors and support

### Language Features

* local-variable type inference aka `var`
* private interface methods
* `try`-with-resources without assignment
* diamond operator for anonymous classes
* `@SafeVarargs` for private methods
* deprecation warnings on imports

### APIs

New:

* collection factories
* reactive streams
* reactive HTTP/2 client
* stack-walking

Updated:

* `String`
* `Stream`
* `Optional`
* OS processes

### JVM Features

* launch single source file
* unified logging
* multi-release JARs
* redirected platform logging
* `jdeps` dependency analysis  \
(even though it's Java 8)

### Performance Improvements
