Java 8 brought a number of new features to the ecosystem.
This course distills the experience of years of day-to-day development work with lambda expressions, `Stream`, `Optional`, and default methods and conveys it to experienced Java 8 developers who want to master these features.
It explains how they changed coding style, where they merely improve development capabilities and where they unlock totally new options.
It discusses performance characteristics, good defaults (not to say best practices), and nooks and crannies to look out for.

Every aspect is taught with theoretical introductions, practical exercises, and usage recommendations.

Optionally, we can also look at the improvements Java versions after 8 bring to these language features and APIs.

## Objectives

After completing this course, participants:

* gained a deeper understanding of lambda expressions, `Stream` API, default methods and `Optional`
* learned about pitfalls, good defaults, and conflicting advice
* can leverage these features even more effectively to the design of their code

## Program

* improving designs (patterns and APIs) with lambda expressions
* writing better code and building better APIs with `Stream`s
* safer use of `Stream`s by avoiding pitfalls and with better exception handling
* `Optional`s history and controversy, usage patterns, recommendations, and its Monadic nature
* conceptual background on default methods, e.g. multiple inheritance and compared to traits, mixins, and abstract classes
* advanced practical use of default methods with reabstracted methods, explicit calls, and for interface evolution

<!--

## Details

### Lambda APIs

* reevaluating design patterns
* designing APIs with lambdas in mind

### Streams

* readable code by using simple building blocks
* staying on one level of abstraction
* readability over succinctness
* best use of utility methods
* exception handling (try/catch, unchecked, Try, Either)
* the power of reduce
* findFirst, findAny vs findOnly (which doesn't exist)
* performance model
* building APIs with streams as return values and parameters

### Optional

* history and intended use
* controversy over Optional as fields/parameters
* two approaches (Colebourne's pragmatic and my strict)
* Optional is no well-behaving monad and why it matters
* serializability

### Default Methods

* classification and examples
* explicit calls
* reabstracted methods
* code reuse in Java 9+ with private interface methods
* multiple inheritance in Java
* vs. traits, mixins, and abstract classes
* interaction with design patterns
* interface evolution
* documentation
