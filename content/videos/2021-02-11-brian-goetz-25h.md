> Today's problems come from yesterday's solutions.

At [the 25-hour live stream](25h-java), Brian and I talk about a few things that annoy Java developers today, why they are the way they are, and what could have been done differently. Our topics (link to timestamps in video):

* [What's wrong with serialization?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyTH8uCziI4&t=03m28s)
* [How it could've been better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyTH8uCziI4&t=12m06s)
* [`null` - the hole in Java's type system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyTH8uCziI4&t=19m20s)
* [Why that's not easy to fix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyTH8uCziI4&t=23m20s)
