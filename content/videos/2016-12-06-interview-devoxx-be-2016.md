Katharine Beaumont interviewed me at Devoxx Belgium about JUnit 5.
We discussed the reasons for the rewrite, the differences to JUnit 4, the underlying architecture and its potential to spawn a new generation of testing frameworks in the JVM.
Last but not least we talked about missing pieces, particularly in the extension API.
