Effective Java,Third Edition, took me by surprise.
After having read the second edition, I figured I would only read the new items, but I was so wrong!
It sucked my right back in and I ended up rereading the entire book.
I rediscovered all the details I forgot, connected the content with my personal experiences from about a decade of Java development, and had a lot of fun trying to find angles Josh hadn't covered.

This inspired me to start [a YouTube series on Effective Java](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_-IO8LOLuNqUzvXfRCWRRJBswKEbLhgN), which this video kicks off.
Come with me on a journey that goes back to the roots and makes us experts in the Java core language!
