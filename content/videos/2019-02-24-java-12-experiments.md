My first [live stream](https://twitch.tv/nipafx)!
We dug around in Java 12, cataloging new features and experimenting with a few of them, most notably `String::indent` and `transform`, `Collectors::teeing`, and additions to `CompletableFuture`.

Thanks again to everyone who was there. 🙏
I had an amazing time.
