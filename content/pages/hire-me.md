<h2 id="training">Training</h2>

Want to bring your developers up to speed on a new Java release? Starting with Java 8 and going all the way to 12, I offer in-house trainings on language changes, new and improved APIs, and JVM enhancements (for some of the content, see posts on Java <a href="//blog.codefx.org/tag/java-8">8</a>, <a href="//blog.codefx.org/tag/java-9">9</a>, <a href="//blog.codefx.org/tag/java-10">10</a>, <a href="//blog.codefx.org/tag/java-11">11</a>, <a href="//blog.codefx.org/tag/java-12">12</a>).

Other interesting topics are <a href="//blog.codefx.org/tag/jpms/" title="JPMS on CodeFX">the module system</a> and <a href="//blog.codefx.org/java/java-11-migration-guide/">migration challenges when moving from 8 to 11</a>, including concerns regarding release cadence, licensing, and support. Last, but not least, I offer courses on <a href="//blog.codefx.org/tag/junit-5/" title="JUnit 5 on CodeFX">JUnit 5</a>.

In a mixture of introductory presentations and practical exercises, attendees will understand how to use these technologies, what pitfalls to avoid, and whether it makes sense to introduce them to existing code bases.

<h2 id="consulting">Consulting</h2>

Are you having trouble with your <a href="//blog.codefx.org/java/java-11-migration-guide">migration to Java 11</a> and beyond? I could help. I can analyze the greatest pitfalls for your project, <a href="//blog.codefx.org/java/planning-your-java-9-update/">develop strategies to evade them</a>, help your developers get the migration going, or even work on it with them.


<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>

If you need a writer to get your company blog or technical site off the ground, I'd be happy to help you out. I mostly write about Java but that's rather a consequence of prioritization not of interest. I ponder on software development in general and would welcome a possibility to write about language independent topics like code reviews, development culture, documentation, etc.

Having established a couple of blogs (this one, one for the initiative <a href="http://blog.do-foss.de/en/">Do-FOSS</a>, and one for my former employer <a href="http://blog.disy.net/">Disy</a>) and having been the editor for <a href="https://sitepoint.com/java">SitePoint's Java channel</a> I can help you set one up that matches your organization's needs. I can also support you to establish a blogging culture, where ideas flow freely from conception, to drafting, to editing and publication.
