<!--
CodeFX is spread across several subdomains. The following sites were created with GitHub Pages so <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-policy">GitHub's Privacy Policy</a> applies:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://libfx.codefx.org">http://libfx.codefx.org</a>/</li>
</ul>

This blog (at http://blog.codefx.org - herafter "CodeFX") has the following privacy policy.

<h2>Usage Statistics</h2>

CodeFX recieves non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the requested URL, browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. CodeFX also recieves potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

CodeFX uses Piwik to create anonymous visitor profiles from those information but anonymizes potentially personally-identifying data before processing. By dropping the last two (of four) blocks of the IP address, it can not be used to personally identify a visitor. CodeFX does, however, use cookies (see below) to identify a visitor's profile when he returns to CodeFX in the future.

The profiles are used to create statistics before being routinely deleted every three months. Those statistics do not allow any inference of a single visitor's behavior.

CodeFX’ purpose in creating such profiles and statistics is to better understand how its visitors use this website.

<h3>Opt Out</h3>

You can opt out of being tracked.

<h3>Do Not Track</h3>

Most browsers have a "Do Not Track" option. It informs visited sites that the user does not wish to have any information about him or her stored.

CodeFX respects the visitor's declaration of her will. In that case, no data will be stored and no anonymous profile will be created.

<h2>Cookies</h2>

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.

CodeFX uses cookies to help Piwik identify a visitor's profile. Visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies.

<h2>Newsletter</h2>

If a user subscribed to CodeFX' newsletter, she has supplied her email address. CodeFX will send two kinds of emails:
<ul>
	<li>notification of new posts (sent each time a new post is published)</li>
	<li>other reasons, e.g. to solicit feedback (kept to a minimum; sent maybe once a month)</li>
</ul>

CodeFX will not connect the subscriber's email address with any other information, e.g. the anonymous visitor profiles (see above).

The newsletter will not contain any tracking links, beacons or other technology which allows to determine whether a subscriber read the newsletter or followed a link therein.

<h2>Comments</h2>

Comments are handled by Disqus. This entails that a visitor of http://blog.codefx.org will connect to Disqus and will be subject to <a href="https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466259-privacy-policy" title="Disqus Privacy Policy">their privacy policy</a>.

Users wishing to avoid connecting to Disqus may install privacy-enhancing browser plugins, such as <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/en/" title="Ghostery">Ghostery</a>, <a href="http://noscript.net/" title="NoScript">NoScript</a> or <a href="https://www.abine.com/index.html" title="DoNotTrackMe">DoNotTrackMe</a>.

<h2>Protection of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

Unless required by law, CodeFX will share no visitor related information with anyone. The only exception are the aggregated usage statistics, which allow no inference of any single visitor's behavior.

CodeFX takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>

Although most changes are likely to be minor, CodeFX may change its privacy policy from time to time and in its sole discretion. CodeFX encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its privacy policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this privacy policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.

<h2>Visitor Rights</h2>

The visitor has the right to request disclosure of all information stored about him. This is free of charge. He has the right to correct and request deletion of his personal data.
