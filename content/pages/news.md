For a few years now, I have been writing a newsletter - first weekly, now every few months - about whatever recently caught my interest or what I'm working on.
I might be talking about some library, framework, or tool I am using at the time, what I've written or read that might interest you, progress on a project I am working on, interesting questions I saw on StackOverflow, conference visits, odd tweets, anything really that connects to Java, software development, or content creation.

Also SciFi and Lego!

If you want to take a look, I publish each newsletter a few days later [on Medium](https://medium.com/codefx-weekly).
It's less polished than the blog, but not as meandering as the live streams - good middle ground, I'd say. ðŸ˜‰
I'd be delighted to have you around!
