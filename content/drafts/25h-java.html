On May 23rd 2020, Java turns 25 ü•≥ and what better way to celebrate its birthday than with <strong>a 25-hour live stream</strong>? (<a href="https://twitch.tv/nipafx">On Twitch.</a>) Yes, 25 hours of Java! There will be technical deep dives, interviews, discussions, cake, code, more cake, and even more code! Most importantly, it will be a lot of fun and I hope you join me on that fine Saturday in May.

I'm still putting everything together and will update this site as I go. For breaking news as they happen <a href="https://twitter.com/nipafx">follow me on Twitter</a>; for regular summaries, <a href="http://blog.codefx.org/newsletter/">subscribe to my newsletter</a>. Here's what I know so far...

<h2>Guests</h2>

It takes a village to raise a child and it takes plenty of talented people to keep the Java train moving - I'll be talking to a few of them.

<h2>Timeline</h2>

Here's what I plan to dissect and discuss with you. I will have slides, repos, and a rough idea where we're going, but the cool thing about a stream is that you're there with me, so you can ask questions, decide what to emphasize, and tell me where to go next. That also means that the timeline may not be strictly adhered to. üòÅ

<dl>
	<dt>0600 UTC ‚Äî Java 9-14 questions from StackOverflow</dt>
	<dd>We'll warm up with answering a few StackOverflow questions <a href="https://stackexchange.com/filters/371955/java-9">from this filter</a>. And in case we ever need to fill a little time, we can always come back to this.</dd>

	<dt>0700 UTC ‚Äî Birthday ü•≥, Cake üéÇ, and Java Q&A üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</dt>
	<dd>This is when, over in California where Java was released, the 23rd starts, so we'll have some cake and chat about Java. Bring your opinions and questions!</dd>

	<dt>0800 UTC ‚Äî Stream Exception Handling</dt>
	<dd>Handling (checked) exceptions in stream pipelines is not trivial. Let's explore and discuss the options. (I explained some in <a href="https://blog.codefx.org/java/repackaging-exceptions-streams/">this post about repackaging exceptions in stream</a>.)</dd>

	<dt>0900 UTC ‚Äî Kevlin Henney</dt>
	<dd>Apparently, there are 97 things every Java programmer should know and Kevlin collected all of them (<a href="https://medium.com/97-things">online</a> and in <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920048824.do">a book</a>). üòâ We'll discuss a few as well as draw from Kevlin's extensive experience in software development to learn about Java's place in history.</dd>

	<dt>1100 UTC ‚Äî The Java Module System</dt>
	<dd>First a quick ride through <a href="https://blog.codefx.org/tag/jpms/">the module system</a> basics before we take a closer look at a two or three more advanced features. (Could be jlink, services, versioning, or something else - if you want to request a topic, <a href="https://twitter.com/nipafx">ping me on Twitter</a>.)</dd>

	<dt>1300 UTC ‚Äî Trisha Gee</dt>
	<dd>What does it take to have a career as a software developer? Which skills do you need and what should you look out for? We'll talk about what's really important to developers when thinking about their careers, and discuss tools for working out what your next steps are.</dd>

	<dt>1500 UTC ‚Äî JUnit 5 Extension</dt>
	<dd><a href="https://junit.org/junit5/">JUnit 5</a> is pretty cool in many regards. Maybe the coolest thing is <a href="https://blog.codefx.org/design/architecture/junit-5-extension-model/">its extensibility</a> and we can dive deep into that. I'll show you theory and practice of writing your own extensions.</dd>

	<dt>1700 UTC ‚Äî Java Releases and Distributions</dt>
	<dd>The switch to the six-month release cadence as well as the commercialization of Oracle JDK changed the ecosystem quite a lot. Let's dive into this topic, so we're ready to discuss it with...</dd>

	<dt>1800 UTC ‚Äî Martijn Verburg</dt>
	<dd>Martijn is here to help us sort out the new release cadence and different Java distributions. We'll also talk about what <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">AdoptOpenJDK</a> can do for us and how Microsoft contributes to the Java ecosystem.</dd>

	<dt>1900 UTC ‚Äî Projects Amber, Valhalla, Loom, and Leyden</dt>
	<dd>There are quite a few very interesting <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/">OpenJDK projects</a> being worked on. We'll shortly summarize each of them and then take a closer look at one (Loom?).</dd>

	<dt>2000 UTC ‚Äî Brian Goetz</dt>
	<dd>There are a few aspects of Java that aren't necessarily the way "things are done today" (mutability/nullability by default, serialization, primitives, etc.), but I keep wondering whether Java would have made it to 25 years without them. Brian is here to discuss this with us: Why is Java the way it is, what could have been done differently, and what can be done now? During the latter, we can take a peek into the future and discuss projects Amber and Valhalla.
	</dd>

	<dt>2200 UTC ‚Äî Going to Java 9</dt>
	<dd>Enough talk about Java's past, presence, and future - let's get moving! I'll show you how to upgrade your code base from <a href="https://blog.codefx.org/tag/java-8/">Java 8</a> to <a href="https://blog.codefx.org/tag/java-9">9</a> and which new features Java's last three-years-in-the-making release has to offer (besides the module system). We'll also turn to an existing code base to check which features we can apply.</dd>

	<dt>2330 UTC ‚Äî Christian Stein</dt>
	<dd>Christian wrote <a href="https://github.com/sormuras/bach">Bach</a>, a JShell-based build tool that uses the power of <a href="https://blog.codefx.org/tag/jpms/">the Java module system</a> to build your Java project.</dd>

	<dt>0000 UTC on the 24th ‚Äî Going to Java 10 and 11</dt>
	<dd><a href="https://blog.codefx.org/tag/java-10/">Java 10</a> and <a href="https://blog.codefx.org/tag/java-11/">11</a> come with a bunch of API and JVM improvements that we can take a look at. Once again, we will apply some of those in practice.</dd>

	<dt>0200 UTC ‚Äî Venkat Subramaniam</dt>
	<dd>Java is not an island, it doesn't exist in isolation. Not only is it related to other JVM languages, it also impacts and is impacted by other programming languages, chief among them C/C++. Venkat is a true polyglot programmer and will help us place Java into the larger software development landscape.
	</dd>

	<dt>0400 UTC ‚Äî Fun with <code>var</code></dt>
	<dd>There's so much fun to be had with <code>var</code>! Mixing it with generics we can recreate <a href="https://blog.codefx.org/java/intersection-types-var/">intersection types</a> and <a href="https://blog.codefx.org/java/traits-var/">traits</a> - be careful, though, these tricks may blow up in unexpected ways.</dd>

	<dt>0500 UTC ‚Äî Going to Java 12 to 14</dt>
	<dd><a href="https://blog.codefx.org/java/switch-expressions/">Switch expressions</a>, <a href="https://blog.codefx.org/java/text-blocks/">text blocks</a>, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/language/pattern-matching-instanceof-operator.html">pattern matching</a>, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/language/records.html">records</a> - the new releases offer a plethora of new language features that we can study and apply.</dd>

	<dt>0600 UTC ‚Äî Sharat Chander</dt>
	<dd>Talking about the community, hanging out, cleaning up, munching cake.</dd>
