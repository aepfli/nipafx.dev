My Gatsby site.

## Content

The site shows various kinds of content, like blog posts, YouTube videos, newsletters, and more.
To keep things organized, I defined some terms:

* **Article**: What is usually called a blog post - a full-blown article on any topic.
* **Video**: Small post linking to a YouTube video
* **Post**: The sum of all of the above.
