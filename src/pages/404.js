					I'm terribly sorry this happened and I really hope you can find what you're
					looking for - on this blog, but also in life. It's not easy to achieve your
					goals and broken sites throwing a wrench into your daily business aren't exactly
					helping. But look at the bright side: You're out and about learning about
					Java and that's pretty cool!
				</p>
				<p>
					I'd love to help you as much as I can. If you reach out to me{" "}
					<Link to={"https://twitter.com/nipafx"}>on Twitter</Link> or{" "}
					<Link to={"mailto:foo@bar.de?subject=404 on nipafx.dev&"}>via mail</Link> and
					let me know what you were looking for, I'll find it and get back to you ASAP.
