					I'm terribly sorry this happened and I really hope you can find what you're
					looking for - on this blog, but also in life. It's not easy to achieve your
					goals and broken sites throwing a wrench into your daily business aren't exactly
					helping.
				</p>
				<p>
					But look at the bright side: You're out and about learning about Java and that's
					pretty cool! I'd love to help you with that as much as I can: If you
					<Link to="contact">reach out to me</Link> and let me know what you were looking
					for, I'll find it and get back to you ASAP.
